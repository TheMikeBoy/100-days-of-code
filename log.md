# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: November 02, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I taked  me one hour, a little more, to prepare my dev enviorement, and after I started my python lessons. About the leasons, I went back to the basics, dispide I have skills in other programming languages, I proposed to begin in the first steps, like inputs and prints, variables and indentetion.

**Thoughts:** how I expected, on the beginning was very exciting, but after 1 hours was boring, because is realy simple exercises.

**Link to work:** you can see my progress here, in my github, on python's directory
