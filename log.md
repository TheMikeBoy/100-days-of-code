# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: November 02, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I taked  me one hour, a little more, to prepare my dev enviorement, and after I started my python lessons. About the leasons, I went back to the basics, dispide I have skills in other programming languages, I proposed to begin in the first steps, like inputs and prints, variables and indentetion.

**Thoughts:** how I expected, on the beginning was very exciting, but after 1 hours was boring, because is realy simple exercises.

### Day 2: November 04, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I only did some exercises on my day 2. I'm tired today because I had insomnia and so I'm thinking not so well

**Thoughts:** I will stop for today, I make one hour exactly of my training, and tomorrow I will recover the planning and do more.
