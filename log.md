# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: November 02, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I taked  me one hour, a little more, to prepare my dev enviorement, and after I started my python lessons. About the leasons, I went back to the basics, dispide I have skills in other programming languages, I proposed to begin in the first steps, like inputs and prints, variables and indentetion.

**Thoughts:** how I expected, on the beginning was very exciting, but after 1 hours was boring, because is realy simple exercises.

### Day 4: November 06, 2021

**Today's Progress**:   My progress today was: random, list, nested list and I maked a scissor, paper and rock game. Was Really simple, but it was nice to remember how logics works and how can be different between persons.
**Thoughts:**  I really have to focus more on exercise because my phone steals a lot of time away from me.

### Day 6: November 08, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I study pythons loops and how to use them.  
**Thoughts:**  my new study habit is working, but it's a little slow, I'm watching classes and these videos take a long time to cover some basic things, but it's good to follow these little steps, maybe doing it fast isn't the best way.

### Day 7: November 10, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Yes, I skipped a day because I had a headache, sorry for lose the streak. But today I learned about while loops and completed some challenges. 
**Thoughts:**   I was reading about indentation in python and noticed a discussion about using spaces and tabs for indentation, and to my surprise  the official documentation recommends using four spaces. This is funny because it is nothing at all productive.

### Day 7 to day 13 : November 10- November 16,  2021 
**week's Progress**: I changed the frequency in my logs, because it was getting boring and I had  to study more things in python. Today I use python to do a Log analysis. In the akamai datastream files, I started  writing functions to extract gzip files, save them in the same directory, read and change  the timestamp column  to datetime using pandas library. 
 **Thoughts:**  I'm getting better every day and understanding more how I can use python in my day at work.

### Day 14, November 17,  2021 
**week's Progress**: Today I implemented a sum function with Pandas Dataframe  to sum the values in a column if the column has the user input value. The function runs in  directories and subdirectories searching for the files who has the value
